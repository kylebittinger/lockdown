Title: Check files and variables to make sure they haven't changed
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kyle Bittinger
Maintainer: Kyle Bittinger <kylebittinger@gmail.com>
Description: Erik had this idea during code review: sometimes, when we are
    producing reports or plots, it would be nice to ensure that certain output
    files or data structures don't change after a certain point in the code.
    This package provides functions to check the contents of a file or
    the value of a variable. During each check, a hash of the current value is
    compared to a hash from the last time the file or variable was checked.  If
    the value is unchanged, nothing will happen.  If the value has changed,
    you'll see a huge nasty error message.
